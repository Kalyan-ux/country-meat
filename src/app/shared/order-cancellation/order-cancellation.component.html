  <h1>Order Cancellation and Reschedule Policy</h1>

  <p>
    These terms and conditions govern Country Meat Private Limited’s (“Country Meat”) Order Cancellation and
    Reschedule Policy. Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned under the
    Terms of Service which govern your use of our website
    <a href="https://www.countrymeat.co.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.countrymeat.co.in</a>

  <h2>Cancellation of Orders</h2>
  <p>
    Users placing scheduled orders may choose to cancel their Orders free of charge, provided the cancellation is made a
    minimum of <strong>24 hours</strong> before the scheduled slot start time. Cancellation requests received after this
    specified time window will result in a cancellation fee of up to 100% of the order value. This is because Country Meat
    follows a Just-in-Time model, our birds are transported from farms to the slaughtering unit only when needed, with
    minimal stock kept on-site. This ensures freshness, hygiene, and free-range rearing. Late cancellations aren’t
    possible once the birds are allocated for your order.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, subject to the User's previous cancellation history or on the basis of misuse of this Policy or any other
    Policy, Country Meat reserves the right to suspend, terminate and/or cancel the order placed by the User without
    reason and may charge a penalty of up to 100% of the order value and take any other necessary action not limited to
    initiating legal action against the User.
  </p>

  <p>
    Country Meat reserves the right to collect a penalty of up to 100% of the order value for the Orders constrained to

    <li>In the event if the address provided by the User is either wrong or falls outside the delivery zone;</li>
